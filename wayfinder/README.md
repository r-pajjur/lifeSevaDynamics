# Wayfinder

Photo-by-photo indoor directions. A visitor scans a QR code posted on a wall,
picks where they are going, and walks through one photo per leg with an arrow
drawn over it.

## How a visit works

1. The QR code encodes the anchor it is posted at:
   `https://<site>/wayfinder/?at=cafeteria`
2. The app reads `at`, shows "You are at Cafeteria", and lists destinations.
3. Picking one runs a breadth-first search over the authored steps and plays
   the shortest path, one photo at a time.

If `at` is missing or unknown, the app asks the visitor to tap where they are
instead of failing.

## The map: `public/building.json`

Two keys, and that is the whole model.

```jsonc
{
  "nodes": {
    "cafeteria": { "label": "Cafeteria", "destination": true },
    "rooms-200": {
      "label": "Rooms 200–220",
      "destination": true,
      "rooms": { "from": 200, "to": 220 }   // typed room numbers land here
    }
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "from": "cafeteria",
      "to": "sunroom",
      "photo": "pic1.jpg",                  // a file in public/photos/
      "arrow": "straight",                  // left | right | straight | up | down
      "text": "Leave the cafeteria through the doorway ahead."
    }
  ]
}
```

- **nodes** are QR anchor points. `destination: true` puts one in the
  "Where to?" list; leave it off for hallway junctions people pass through but
  never ask for.
- **steps** are directed: each one is a single walk between two adjacent
  anchors, authored once and reused by every route that passes through it.
- **rooms** lets one anchor stand in for a numbered range, so a visitor types
  `214` instead of hunting through twenty list entries.

Arrows are SVG drawn on top of the photo at runtime, never baked into the image
— so re-labelling a leg means editing one line of JSON, not reshooting.

## Adding a leg

1. Photograph the walk, facing the direction of travel.
2. Drop the JPG in `public/photos/`. Roughly 1400px on the long edge keeps the
   page quick: `sips -Z 1400 -s formatOptions 72 in.JPG --out public/photos/x.jpg`
3. Add the node to `nodes` if it is new, and a `steps` entry pointing at the
   photo.
4. Print a QR code for `?at=<that node id>` and post it at the spot.

No code changes are needed — the graph, the search and the player all read from
the JSON.

## What is still placeholder

The cafeteria → rooms 200–220 route is real photography. **Mandir** and
**library** are stubs: they use `photos/placeholder.svg` and their step text is
marked `PLACEHOLDER`. Replace both once those legs are photographed.

Steps are directed, so the map currently routes *to* the rooms but not back.
Walking the route in reverse and photographing it adds the return legs.

## Commands

```bash
npm start          # ng serve, http://localhost:4200
npm run build      # production build into dist/wayfinder/browser
```

The production build sets `--base-href /wayfinder/`, which is where the site
serves it. The service worker (`@angular/pwa`) caches the app shell, the map and
the photos, so a visitor who loaded it once can still navigate on the building's
dead spots.
